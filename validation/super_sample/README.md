# Congenica super sample

This VCF is used to validate the congenica platform after each release.
The VCF is uploaded using any and all upload methods, before the variants are used to check the platform is working in the expected way (see relevent KB article).

These variants were compiled by the monogenics team and converted into a VCf by the bioinformatics team.

Note that the VCFs are compressed (.tar.gz) and stored in 001_ToolsReferenceData.
