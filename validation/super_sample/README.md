# Congenica super sample

This VCF is used to validate the congenica platform after each release.
The VCF is uploaded using any and all upload methods, before the variants are used to check the platform is working in the expected way (see relevent KB article).

These variants were compiled by the monogenics team and converted into a VCF by the bioinformatics team.

Note that the VCFs are zipped using bgzip (.gz - not .tar.gz!) and stored in 001_ToolsReferenceData.

## super_sample_v2.0.0
This sample has the addition of 4 variants that have been added to test the Congenica blacklist functionality.

This has been uploaded to congenica to ensure that it is a valid VCF and can be used to test the blacklist functionality

## super_sample_v3.0.0
This sample has one extra variant used to test the FH blacklist

This has been uploaded to congenica to ensure that it is a valid VCF.
