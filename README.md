# Validation

This repository contains script and utilities to create reproducible NGS assay validations

## Cancer


### sensitivity and specificity

### Coverage


#### Fraction above threshold


#### Known clinically relevant threshold


#### Missed regions


### Allele frequency representation


### Limit of detection


### Other considerations
