# Validation

This repository contains script and utilities to create reproducible NGS assay validations


## Cancer


### Sensitivity and specificity


### Reproducibility


### Coverage


#### Fraction above threshold


#### Known clinically relevant threshold


#### Missed regions


### Allele frequency representation


### Limit of detection
Two sample virtual intermixing to determine AF limit of detection.

### Other considerations
